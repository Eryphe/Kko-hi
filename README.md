# Kko-hi

A open-source **Discord bot** coded in **CoffeeScript** 2.5.1. Uses HexoDB 1.5 (GitHub version)

### Features

- Build you own Discord bot in CoffeeScript!
- Absolutely little JavaScript!
- Minimalized tools!
- Built in event and command handler!
- Be unique! Most people code Discord bots in JavaScript xD

## Getting Started

Set up the .env file to achieve best results.
```env
token=
prefix=
hexodb=
```
Or the keys.json file.
```json
{
  "token": "",
  "prefix": "",
  "hexodb": ""
}
```
HexoDB IS NOT WORKING AS OF 2021!<br>
You may get your own HexoDB database [here](https://hexodb.glitch.me).<br>
It's an OK alternative for a database if you don't want to learn MongoDB yet xD.<br>
Unlike a local SQLite Database, HexoDB works on Heroku/Glitch/Repl.<br>
Your HexoShard should be hosted on [Repl.it](https://repl.it)
It's free, and open-source too!

That's it! You now have your own Kko-hi!

## Support
Kko-hi is now archived.<br>

P.S. - The GitHub version is different from the Repl.it version. This one uses HexoDB as its database, but the Repl.it version uses ReplDB.
